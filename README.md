# Preprocess_EyeTrack

This pipeline is for preprocessing eye tracking data for use with data obtained with the [EyeLink 1000Plus](http://www.sr-research.com/mount_desktop_1000plus.html). 

You can specify experiment parameters in `Settings_EyeTrack.m`, including viewing distance and screen size, trial timing, and file names and directories. 

`runEyeTrack.m` will run the preprocessing scripts.
